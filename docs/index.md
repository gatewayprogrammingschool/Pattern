# Pattern

Pattern is a LLVM based language to provide a modern approach to system development and architecture based on standard design patterns.

## Philosophy

Object oriented design principles have provided the strongest foundation for architecting large applications for decades.  Object oriented provides the ability to not only [encapsulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) code, but also extend code in ways that provide for [strong cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)) of objects and domains while [loosely coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) implementations from their sibling implementations.  Pattern strives to provide an expressive language that standardizes how many OOP (Object Oriented Programming) patterns are defined and _implemented_.
