/* Pattern Language Sample 1
   This Application uses a classic MVC pattern to manipulate a set of data
   stored in a Model.

   Concepts Covered:
   - Application
   - Controller
   - View
   - Model

// Application Scope is the equivalent of a Namespace
// Each Pattern source file must have an Application Scope declaration.
Application Scope Ninja::TheSharp

// Namespace of outside library.  Namespaces use :: before Each
// identifying segment.  A fully qualified type is a Namespace
// pointing to a type --   ::System->Console
// In this way, naming collisions between namespaces and types
// are always avoided.

// Application is the root instance of the application. It's constructor
// Is the entry point to our program.  It does not have parameters defined
// As they are fixed to the obligatory Array of Strings.
